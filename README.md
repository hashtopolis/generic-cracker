# Hashtopolis Bcrypt Generic Cracker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hashtopolis/generic-cracker.svg?branch=bcrypt)](https://travis-ci.com/hashtopolis/generic-cracker)

Generic cracker example which is compatible with Hashtopolis.

Slightly adjusted from the main version to be able to crack bcrypt hashes. Bcrypt implementation is taken from https://github.com/trusch/libbcrypt

**Note**: The bcrypt implementation seems to have a problem with compiling on Windows, but it works on Linux and OS X.
